# Boostrap of the testing environment of this Python application cannot be
# performed the traditional way with actions/setup-python as some of the Python
# dependencies (rpm, dnf) are not available in PyPI, they are only distributed
# as system packages in major Linux distributions repositories. For this reason,
# containers are used with distribution package manager to install all
# dependencies.
