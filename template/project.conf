# Remote repositories can be synchronized in local mirrors when `sync` key is
# defined in repos definition.
#
# 3 synchronization methods are supported: dnf (default), lftp and epel. With
# dnf method, rift downloads repository metadata to discover packages referenced
# in the repository. With lftp method, `lftp mirror` is executed on the given
# URL. With epel method, rift downloads EPEL files index and download all files
# under the given URL. Default method is lftp.
#
# Include and exclude regex patterns can be specified to restrict list of
# synchronized files.
#
# repos:
#     os:
#         sync:
#             source: https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/9/BaseOS
